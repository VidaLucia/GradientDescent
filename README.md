# Gradient Descent Visualizer

## Overview
This project visually demonstrates how **gradient descent** optimizes a function by iteratively moving toward the minimum. It plots a 3D loss surface and shows how a point updates its position over time as it follows the gradient. Useful for both learning and teaching optimization techniques in machine learning.

## Objectives
- Visualize the gradient descent algorithm step-by-step
- Show the optimization path over a cost function
- Allow real-time adjustment of learning rate and starting position

## Feature
- Animate the gradient descent steps over a cost function (e.g., paraboloid or Rosenbrock)

## Technologies
- **Python with Matplotlib (3D plots)**   

## Skills I've Learned
- Gradient descent math and logic
- 3D rendering of mathematical surfaces
- Debugging numeric instability and overshooting

## TODO:
- Display the learning trajectory in 3D (surface plot + point)
- User controls for:
  - Learning rate
  - Initial guess
  - Step-by-step or auto-run mode
